    <p>My mom always said: <q>Panza llena, corazon contento.</q></p>
    <blockquote>
        All the world’s a stage,<br><br>
        And all the men and women merely players;<br>
        They have their exits and their entrances,<br>
        And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
        His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,<br>
        Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.<br>
        Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel<br>
        And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br>
        Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
        Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br>
        Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br>
        Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,<br>
        Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>
        Seeking the bubble reputation</br><br>
        Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,<br>
        In fair round belly with good capon lined,<br>
        With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br>
        Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br>
        And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br>
        Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,<br>
        With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;<br>
        His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide<br>
        For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,<br>
        Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br>
        And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br>
        That ends this strange eventful history,<br>
        Is second childishness and mere oblivion,<br>
        Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.<br>
